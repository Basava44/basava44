      "detailed": "With a strong foundation in Angular, Ember.js, Vue.js, and React, I’ve spent over 4 years building robust and maintainable applications for enterprises and startups alike. I take pride in creating modular, reusable code and translating design concepts into efficient, scalable frontends. My experience extends to backend development using Golang and Node.js, giving me an end-to-end perspective on web application architecture. Beyond code, I’m working on a side project called 'Flink' (WIP) — a social link-sharing app that connects people more meaningfully. Outside tech, I find balance in photography, journaling, and riding my Yezdi Scrambler."
